* Find an alternative to recursion in Read() because
	there is no tailcall optimization

* Enabling/disabling the removal of different directives
	from the output

* Expand defines

* Keep the raw line around so that escaped newlines
	aren't removed from the output send around to
	the caller of Read()

* #if

* #error/#warning

* Function-style defines

* Fix the tests
